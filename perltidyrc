# perltidyrc file for perltidy itself
# Note:
# - This is not named .perltidyrc because that could interfere
#   with testing. This has to be requested with -pro=perltidyrc
# - Formatting without these parameters remains stable, so it is not
#   necessary to format with these parameters every time. But it should
#   be done before a commit.

# such as the following is placed in the corresponding source code:
#    my @unique_hash_keys_uu = qw( maximum_line_length );
# The name '@unique_hash_keys_uu' is arbitrary but should end in _uu
# to be itself excluded from warnings, as noted above.
